# Weekly notes

* Week of June 21: Refined the daybook CLI so I can pinch a domain view quickly before the next side project push.
* Week of June 23: Started keeping a quick `scripts/daybook_report.py` as a ritual after evening hacking; it prints the last line items and domain totals.
* Week of June 25: Added a testing note and rounded out the README so the story stays human even though the repo is just me scribbling.
